# simple-pomodoro-timer
This is a Command Line Interface (CLI) Pomodoro timer application developed in C++. The application helps users to manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique, a time-management method developed by Francesco Cirillo.

Key Features:

Allows setting custom durations for work periods, short breaks, and long breaks.
Shows system notifications at the end of each work period and break period, helping users stay on track.
Uses default durations (25 minutes for work, 5 minutes for short breaks, and 30 minutes for long breaks) if the user doesn't input a custom value.
Implements the traditional Pomodoro cycle: four work periods separated by short breaks, followed by a long break.
Dependencies:

This program uses the osascript command to show macOS notifications, so it is currently only compatible with macOS.
Future improvements could include cross-platform compatibility for notifications, and more advanced features like saving/loading Pomodoro schedules, or integrating with other productivity apps or services. Contributions are welcome!
